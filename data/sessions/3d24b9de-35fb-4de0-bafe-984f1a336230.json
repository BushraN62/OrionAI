      "content": "To integrate the expression $\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\tan(x)}$ divided by $(x^3 - 1)^3$, we first simplify and then proceed with integration.\n\nLet's start by simplifying the integrand:\n\n1. **Simplify the Integrand:**\n   The given expression is $\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\tan(x)}$. Recall that $\\tan(x) = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}$.\n\n2. **Substitute and Simplify:**\n   Substitute $\\tan(x)$ in the integrand:\n   $$\n\n   \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\tan(x)} = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}} = \\cos(x)\n   \n$$\n   So, our integral simplifies to:\n   $$\n\n   \\int \\frac{\\sin(x)}{(\\cos(x))^3} dx\n   \n$$\n\n3. **Rewrite the Integrand:**\n   Recognize that the integrand can be written as:\n   $$\n\n   \\int \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x^3 - 1}\\,dx\n   \n$$\n   \nNow we have simplified it to integrate $\\frac{\\sin(x)}{(x-1)(x^2 + x + 1)^2}$.\n\n4. **Integration by Parts:**\n   To solve this integral, recognize that the integrand can be expressed using partial fractions or substitution, but let's use a more straightforward approach involving integration by parts.\n\n5. **Use Trigonometric Identities and Substitutions:**\n\nConsider:\n$$\n\n\\frac{\\sin(x)}{(x-1)(x^2 + x + 1)^2}\n\n$$\n\nThis can be seen as:\n$$\n\n\\int \\left(\\frac{A}{x-1} + \\frac{Bx+C}{(x-1)(x^2 + x + 1)}\\right) dx\n\n$$\nwhere $A, B,$ and $C$ are determined through polynomial long division or by inspection. This process will yield a more manageable form that can be integrated directly.\n\n6. **Integration Strategy:**\n   Using partial fraction decomposition or direct integration techniques:\n   $$\n\n   \\int \\left(\\frac{1}{x-1} - \\frac{x+2}{(x^2 + x + 1)^2}\\right) dx\n   \n$$\n\n7. **Integrate Each Term Separately:**\n\n   For the first term, integrate $\\int \\frac{1}{x-1}\\,dx$:\n   $$\n\n   \\int \\frac{1}{x-1} dx = \\ln|x - 1|\n   \n$$\n\n   The second term can be integrated by recognizing it as a derivative of a function involving $x^2 + x + 1$.\n\n8. **Final Answer:**\n\nAfter integrating each term and combining the results, we get:\n$$\n\n\\int \\frac{\\sin(x)}{(x-1)(x^2 + x + 1)^2} dx = \\ln|x - 1| - \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{4}} \\cdot \\frac{x+2}{(x^2 + x + 1)^\\frac{5}{3}} \\right) + C\n\n$$\n\nThis is the final result after simplifying and combining terms:\n\n$$\n\n\\boxed{\\ln|x - 1| - \\frac{(x+2)}{\\sqrt[3]{4}(x^2 + x + 1)^{\\frac{5}{3}}} + C}\n\n$$",

We can use trigonometric identities and relationships:\n$$\n\n\\tan(x) = \\sec(x) \\cdot \\cos(x)\n\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n\n\\int \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\tan(x)} dx = \\int \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}} dx\n\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Simplify Further\n\nSimplify the integrand further:\n$$\n\n= \\int \\sec(x) \\cdot \\cos(x) \\cdot \\frac{1}{(x^3 - 1)^3} dx\n\n$$\nSince $\\sec(x) = \\frac{1}{\\cos(x)}$, we have:\n$$\n\n= \\int \\frac{\\cos(x)}{(x^3 - 1)^3} dx\n\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Substitute and Integrate\n\nNow, let's integrate by parts. Let $u = \\sec(x)$ and $dv = \\frac{dx}{(x^3 - 1)^3}$. \n\nHowever, the integral $\\int \\frac{\\cos(x)}{(x^3 - 1)^3} dx$ is quite complex and does not have a simple closed form. This suggests that we might need to use more advanced techniques or recognize it as an expression involving special functions.\n\n### Step 5: Recognize Special Function\n\nThe integral $\\int \\frac{\\cos(x)}{(x^3 - 1)^3} dx$ can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions or other special functions, but the exact solution would typically involve these advanced techniques and not simple algebraic integration.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven that this is a complex integral involving products and powers of trigonometric functions, it’s often solved using specialized mathematical software or advanced methods. The result can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions:\n$$\n\n\\int \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\tan(x)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(x^3 - 1)^3} dx = \\boxed{\\text{A function involving hypergeometric series}}\n\n$$",

      "content": "The quadratic formula is used to find the roots of a quadratic equation. A quadratic equation is an equation of the second degree, meaning that the highest power of $x$ (the variable in the equation) is 2.\n\nA general form of a quadratic equation is:\n$$\n ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \n$$\n\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, and $a \\neq 0$.\n\nThe quadratic formula to find the roots of this equation is given by:\n$$\n x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \n$$\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Identify the coefficients** from your quadratic equation in standard form $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.\n\n2. Substitute these values into the quadratic formula.\n\n3. Simplify the expression inside the square root, which is called the discriminant:\n   - If the discriminant ($ b^2 - 4ac $) is positive, there are two distinct real roots.\n   - If the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n   - If the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots but two complex roots.\n\n4. Simplify the entire formula to find the roots of your quadratic equation.\n\nSo, for example, if you have an equation like $2x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0$, then:\n- $a = 2$\n- $b = 3$\n- $c = 1$\n\nPlugging these into the formula gives:\n$$\n x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4*2*1}}{2*2} \n$$\n$$\n x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 8}}{4} \n$$\n$$\n x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{1}}{4} \n$$\n$$\n x = \\frac{-3 \\pm 1}{4} \n$$\n\nThis gives you two roots:\n- $x_1 = \\frac{-3 + 1}{4} = -\\frac{2}{4} = -0.5$\n- $x_2 = \\frac{-3 - 1}{4} = -\\frac{4}{4} = -1$ \n\nSo, the roots of $2x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0$ are $ x = -0.5 $ and $ x = -1 $.",

He is notable for being the first person to be assassinated while in office and surviving long enough to be elected president again after serving two years as a private citizen following his assassination.\n\nGarfield's presidency was marked by efforts to modernize the federal government and improve the nation's economy. However, he did not serve out his full term as many of those around him were more interested in power and influence than duty or service to the country. This ultimately led to Garfield being assassinated on July 2, 1881.\n\nThe assassination was carried out by Charles J. Guiteau, a failed civil servant who had long resented his mistreatment and poor treatment from Garfield. Guiteau claimed that he killed Garfield because of \"maladministration\" during the Civil War and other grievances against Garfield's administration.\n\nGarfield died on September 19, 1881, less than two months after being shot at a railroad station in Washington D.C., but not before becoming the first president to be assassinated while in office.",

The first version of Google was launched in September 1998 when they were living in their dorms at Stanford. It started as a research project focused on searching the internet. Initially, it was called \"Backrub\" because that's what the code used to search for URLs was called.\n\nThe story goes that Larry Page and Sergey Brin were tired of manually entering different websites into their computers. They wanted a quicker way to find information they needed, which led them to create Google as a service to help people find answers faster. Their concept quickly gained traction, leading the two to take it further from their university dorms.\n\nGoogle's journey since its inception has been marked by explosive growth and innovation. It went public on July 4, 2004, with an initial offering that raised $1 billion in capital. The company grew exponentially, particularly after Google acquired DoubleClick for $1.65 billion in November 2003.\n\nGoogle began as a search engine but has since expanded into various areas such as advertising (AdWords), mapping services (Google Maps), productivity software (Google Docs), and cloud computing (G Suite). It's now one of the most recognizable brands in tech, with over 1.8 billion users worldwide and $174.26 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025 according to Forbes.\n\nToday, Google employs approximately 139,000 people globally and has offices across 45 countries, including Silicon Valley, Mountain View, London, Tokyo, New York, Bangalore, Shanghai, Hyderabad, Sydney, and Mumbai.",
